# CCC
Custom Character Creator for SWL  
Lets you create completely new faces by combining all TSW, SWL and unreleased head parts.  
All changes are only visible clientside.  
## Commands
You can use the Export/Import buttons in the settings window to share/save looks.  

Additionally you can use `/option CCC_Export true` and `/option CCC_Import "<lookString>"` to export/import your look.  
Naturally you can make chat scripts for these commands [see here if you don't know how to make scripts](http://legacy.tswdb.com/miscellaneous/chat-scripts).
